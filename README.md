# Emmanuel Berthier's Portfolio

I designed and coded this project that showcases the work of the French photographer Emmanuel Berthier.
It was built using Nuxt 3 and Prismic for content management and delivery, marking my first venture into the use of both this framework and this CMS.

## Features

- **Nuxt 3**: Leveraging the power of Nuxt 3 for a modern, performant, and scalable front-end.
- **Prismic **: Use of Prismic for flexible content management and easy updates without having to go into the code.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
